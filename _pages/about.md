Praise the sun! I am currently at Twitter Cortex as a postdoctoral ML Researcher working on Geometric Deep Learning and more specifically Graph Neural Networks with 
[Michael Bronstein](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UU3N6-UAAAAJ&hl=en). I finished my PhD in Mathematics at UCL with a [thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10133514/) on analysis of singularity formation of rotationally symmetric Ricci Flows. I am now interested in investigating Deep Learning through the lens of Differential Geometry and Physics, with emphasis on graph structured data and treating time as a continuous variable. 

My currecnt lines of research regard: (i) leveraging the graph structure via local tools as curvature to investigate how information flows inside a Message Passing Neural Network - our [first step](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7UmjRGzp-A) in this direction got an [ICLR honorable mention](https://blog.iclr.cc/2022/04/20/announcing-the-iclr-2022-outstanding-paper-award-recipients/)! - and propose principled rewiring approaches inspired by geometric flows. (ii) Study Graph Neural Networks as multi-particles dynamics - [our recent work]() explains how the common "channel-mixing" module can be interpreted as a pairwise potential and how by interacting with the graph Laplacian spectrum it learns to generate attractive or repulsive forces via its positive and neagtive eigenvalues respectively.
