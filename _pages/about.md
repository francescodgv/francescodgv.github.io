Praise the sun! I am currently a Senior Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, working with [Michael Bronstein](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UU3N6-UAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I was a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge and I spent a year at Twitter Cortex as an ML Researcher. I finished my PhD in Mathematics at UCL with a [thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10133514/) on analysis of singularity formation of rotationally symmetric Ricci Flows. I am now interested in Geometric Deep Learning and working on both theoretical foundations and applications in the scientific domain.

My current lines of research include: (i) Understanding how information flows in message passing models and the associated phenomenon of over-squashing using quantities such as curvature and commute time---our [first step](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7UmjRGzp-A) in this direction got an [ICLR honorable mention](https://blog.iclr.cc/2022/04/20/announcing-the-iclr-2022-outstanding-paper-award-recipients/). More recently, we have introduced a [novel paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03589) for studying the expressive power of message-passing models (on graphs and/or point clouds) that precisely depends on the ability to induce interactions (mixing) across different nodes (points). (ii) Investigating how Graph Neural Networks "use" the underlying graph topology and to what extent we need to rely on the same input graph to exchange messages across layers. This direction falls into the field of graph-rewiring: I am working on applying frameworks inspired by these ideas to applied problems with the aim of replacing expensive Transformer-style architectures. A [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08018) explores this direction introducing novel notions of delay and distance-aware skip connections to mitigate vanishing gradients issues and deal with long-range interactions. (iii) Investigating how the geometry of the data can be better leveraged when designing generative modelling approaches (Flow Matching and Diffusion Models). (iv) Analyzing how the training dyamics is affected when enforcing symmetries and/or exact constraints.
