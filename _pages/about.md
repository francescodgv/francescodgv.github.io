Praise the sun! I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Valence Labs, working on deep learning frameworks for reshaping and accelerating computational methods in chemistry and biology. Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate at the University of Oxford working with [Michael Bronstein](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UU3N6-UAAAAJ&hl=en). I also spent time as a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge in [Pietro Li√≤](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4YhNJBEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I finished my PhD in Mathematics at UCL with a [thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10133514/) on analysis of singularity formation of rotationally symmetric Ricci Flows. I am now interested in Geometric Deep Learning, with a recent emphasis on generative models, working on both theoretical foundations and applications in the scientific domain.
